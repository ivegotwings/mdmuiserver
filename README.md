# Riversand Technologies - UI Platform

# Setup - Windows

## Prerequisites

Below steps are needed only for the first time when you setup your dev machine

1. Install node.js server from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2. Install git repository and configure it

    `https://git-scm.com/downloads`

3. Install [bower](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bower)

    `npm install -g bower`

4. Install [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)

    `npm install -g gulp`

5. Install [polymer-cli](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli):

    `npm install -g polymer-cli`

6. Clone this git repository, if you haven't done already. 
This command would create local folder for the repository. Make sure you are in right folder. 

    `git clone https://github.com/riversandtechnologies/ui-platform.git`

## Setup nginx and auth-service
1. Restore AuthSetup-Package from ui-platform repository into your **root** drive (C or D drive). Make sure this directly in the root drive. On restore, c or d drive should have 3 new folders as below:
    - Nginx
    - platformsvc-authenticationsvc
    - var
2. Open \var\lib\rs\dataplatform\config\dataplatformpodconfig.json file and edit nginx section as below: 
Provide node name as local system name. Example: <<machine-name>>.riversand.com. This has to be FQDN (Fully qualified domain name) where domain is riversand.com.  DO NOT USE localhost.

  ```
  "nginx": 
      {
	 "sslEnabled": true,
         "sslPort": 443,
         "httpPort": 80,
         "nodes": 
         [
            "machinename.riversand.com"
         ]
      }
   }, 
   
   ```
   
 3. In ui-platform codebase, update your **socket.io** config.js files to update as  https://<<machine-name>>.riversand.com. This is required to make socket.io work. Here is sample:  
 
    ```
    {
        "notificationManager" : {
            "url": "https://machinename.riversand.com"
        }
     },
     
     ```
    
## Run Nginx, auth-service and ui-platform app:

1. Make sure you don’t have port 80 running. Normally skype,SQL server or your local ISS consumes port 80. To stop IIS, run iisreset -stop. For skype, change skype’ s advanced options

2. In cmd, go to root/nginx and run start nginx. Make sure nginx is running by running command tasklist /fi "imagename eq nginx.exe"

3. Install pm2 with the follwoing command,

    `npm install pm2 –g` 
    
   In cmd, go to root/platformsvc-authenticationsvc/src and run pm2 start app.js --name="auth-service"

4. All the developers running their local nginx need to do below change to get this running.

     - Go to your authservice/src/server folder and open passport.js file. 
     - Search for tenantId and replace value there with “jcpenney”.
     - Restart your auth service
     
5. Run your normal ui-platform using “npm run app” in ui-platform folder.

6. With this, when you open your browser with https://machinename.riversand.com it would redirect you to ask for auth0 authentication and further redirect you to ui app.

## Handy Commands for nginx:

     - start nginx   (it will start nginx)
     - tasklist /fi "imagename eq nginx.exe"  (it will provide status of nginx service)
     - nginx -s quit (it will shut down nginx server gracefully)

## Handy commands to run Auth app as a background service:

     - npm install pm2 –g (it is one time install of pm2)
     - pm2 start app.js --name="authservice" (name can be anything of your choice, it will help you to know the status of your auth app)
     - pm2 stop authservice (to stop auth service app)
     - pm2 status authservice (to know the service status)

## Install local dependencies
Below steps are needed every time you pull new changes, specially in the initial phase of the project. 
This MUST should be done within a command window opened at the `ui-platform` folder path

1. Install local npm dependencies
    
    `npm install`

2. Install local bower dependencies

    `bower install`

npm and bower will not install the components for which the required/latest versions are already available locally, so there is no harm in running them

## Start the development server with live browser reloading

This command serves the app at `http://localhost:8080` and provides basic URL
routing for the app. Internally this command runs `polymer lint & polymer serve & gulp watch`

    npm run app

Use below url format to run main app:
     
    http://localhost:5005/
    
Use below url formats to view element's demo and API page:
     
    http://localhost:5005/src/elements/{component-name}/
    Example: http://localhost:5005/src/elements/pebble-textbox/

## Build
  
This command performs HTML, CSS,and JS minification on the application
dependencies, and generates a service-worker.js file with code to pre-cache the
dependencies based on the entrypoint and fragments specified in `polymer.json`.
The minified files are output to the `build/unbundled` folder, and are suitable
for serving from a HTTP/2+Push compatible server.

In addition the command also creates a fallback `build/bundled` folder,
generated using fragment bundling, suitable for serving from non
H2/push-compatible servers or to clients that do not support H2/Push. 

Internally this command runs `gulp & polymer build` 

    npm run build

## Preview the build

This command serves the minified version of the app in an unbundled state, as it would
be served by a push-compatible server. 
Internally this command runs `polymer lint & gulp & polymer serve build/bundled`

    npm run build/bundled
    # Open your browser and navigate to localhost:8080

This command serves the unbundled version of the app generated using fragment bundling.
Internally this command runs `polymer lint & gulp & polymer serve build/unbundled`

    npm run build/unbundled
    # Open your browser and navigate to localhost:8080

## Run tests

This command will run
[Web Component Tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester) against the
browsers currently installed on your machine. Internally this command runs `gulp & polymer serve build/bundled`

    npm run test

## Run Nginx, auth-service and ui-platform app:

1. Make sure you don’t have port 80 running. Normally skype,SQL server or your local ISS consumes port 80. To stop IIS, run iisreset -stop. For skype, change skype’ s advanced options

2. In Terminal, run `sudo nginx`. Make sure nginx is running by running `sudo nginx` again and confirm the following errors:
    
    'nginx: [emerg] bind() to 0.0.0.0:443 failed (48: Address already in use)'
    'nginx: [emerg] bind() to 0.0.0.0:80 failed (48: Address already in use)'

    **Please note nginx should be listening on 0.0.0.0:443 & 0.0.0.0:80**

3. In Terminal, install pm2 with the follwoing command:

    `npm install pm2 –g` 

4. In Terminal, go to '/platformsvc-authenticationsvc/src' and run 
   
   `pm2 start app.js --name="auth-service"`

5. All the developers running their local nginx need to do below change:

     - Go to '/platformsvc-authenticationsvc/src/server' folder and open 'passport.js' file. 
     - Search for "tenantId" and replace value there with “jcpenney”.
     - Restart your auth service in terminal `pm2 restart all`
     
6. Run your normal ui-platform using `npm run app` in ui-platform folder.

7. With this, when you open your browser with https://machinename.riversand.com it would redirect you to ask for auth0 authentication and further redirect you to ui app.
