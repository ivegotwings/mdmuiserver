# Riversand Technologies - UI Platform

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit)

### Setup

##### Prerequisites

Install [polymer-cli](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli):

    npm install -g polymer-cli

##### Initialize project from template

    mkdir my-app
    cd my-app
    polymer init starter-kit

### Start the development server

This command serves the app at `http://localhost:8080` and provides basic URL
routing for the app:

    polymer serve --open


### Build

This command performs HTML, CSS, and JS minification on the application
dependencies, and generates a service-worker.js file with code to pre-cache the
dependencies based on the entrypoint and fragments specified in `polymer.json`.
The minified files are output to the `build/unbundled` folder, and are suitable
for serving from a HTTP/2+Push compatible server.

In addition the command also creates a fallback `build/bundled` folder,
generated using fragment bundling, suitable for serving from non
H2/push-compatible servers or to clients that do not support H2/Push.

    polymer build

### Preview the build

This command serves the minified version of the app in an unbundled state, as it would
be served by a push-compatible server:

    polymer serve build/unbundled
    # Open your browser and navigate to localhost:8080

This command serves the minified version of the app generated using fragment bundling:

    polymer serve build/bundled
    # Open your browser and navigate to localhost:8080

### Run tests

This command will run
[Web Component Tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester) against the
browsers currently installed on your machine.

    polymer test

### Adding a new view

You can extend the app by adding more views that will be demand-loaded
e.g. based on the route, or to progressively render non-critical sections
of the application.  Each new demand-loaded fragment should be added to the
list of `fragments` in the included `polymer.json` file.  This will ensure
those components and their dependencies are added to the list of pre-cached
components (and will have bundles created in the fallback `bundled` build).
